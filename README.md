# Viewing Pipeline
This project aims to replicate the steps taken by the [geometry part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_pipeline#Geometry) of the [graphics pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_pipeline).

## Acknowledgements
This unity project is based upon the [rendering pipeline tutorial](http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/rendering/part-1/), by [Catlike Coding](http://catlikecoding.com). The original project was expanded to include defining a rendering window, as well as defining clipping planes for the camera.
